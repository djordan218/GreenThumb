# What does this app do?

I always plant something in the spring time and then completely forget about when I'm supposed to be harvesting something. There are also times in the year when I am late planting seeds indoors because I just forget about it. This web app is meant to be the brain behind that and make sure that I know when things are supposed to be planted and when to expect to harvest them.
