Capstone Two - Green Thumb

Tech Stack: NodeJS (backend) & React (frontend)
Going for a balanced fullstack application, verification on server side
Standard web app (a mobile app would be awesome though)

Project Goal: Web app to manage vegetable garden plant/harvest schedule
Will plan to create my own API that users can add to (and potentially search what other crops users have added and then add to their garden)
Home page will be either a user dashboard with a calendar populated with crops theyâ€™ve added (prob use localStorage) or a sign up page (if not logged in)
I will include a test user account for future recruiters 
Targeted toward users that need help managing schedules and potentially setting up email alerts (need to look into this)

Schema: 
Users table
Id
Username
Password
Email
savedCrops

Crops table:
Id
Name
germTime
userId (that added crop)

SavedCrops table:
userId
cropId
